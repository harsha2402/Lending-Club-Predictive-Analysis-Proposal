# Lending-Club-Predictive-Analysis-Proposal
To predict the status of getting a loan without having to submit an application to the banks or having to get a credit check. This model uses the data from the Lending Club provided by the Data Incubator Program. It uses the data to find the whether an user will be eligible for a loan in the future, at a later stage it will also provide the user with the suggestions to banks with their credentials to provide loans, or suggest way to improve their credentials for the being eligible. All this without actually getting a credit check. As we know the loan process can take months but with this model you will know your eligibility almost instantanously.
