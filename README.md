# Lending-Club-Predictive-Analysis-Proposal
To predict the status of getting a loan without having to submit an application to the banks or having to get a credit check. This model uses the data from the Lending Club provided by the Data Incubator Program. 

It uses the data to:
---Find the whether an user will be eligible for a loan in the future, 
---At a later stage it will also provide the user with the suggestions to banks with their credentials to provide loans, 
---Suggest ways to improve their credentials for the being eligible.

All this without actually getting a credit check. As we know the loan process can take months but with this model you will know your eligibility almost instantanously. 

# Future Work
-- The model will produce trained weights to predict the eligibility more accurately by using the Stochastic Gradient Method.
-- The other attributes in the data will be used to make the model more detailed. 
-- The credit check process will be recreated without actually using the credit check API.
-- The model will be made into a Website for public usage. 
-- The model will calculate the covariance of each entry and see which attributes play a mojor role in the prediction.
-- The model will be tested against various other regressiion models such as lasso, ridge etc.
